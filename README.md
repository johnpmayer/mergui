# Mergui
A simple gui system for the quicksilver engine, developed for use in [Arena keeper](https://github.com/lenscas/arena_keeper_quick)

## Why

Simple, right now there is no GUI system at all for quicksilver and worse the few libraries that compile to WASM are based on wasm-bindgen and as a result not compatible with quicksilver.

This project is created to fill in the gap until a better compatible library shows up.

## Widgets

Right now it can only be used for buttons, but more widgets are planned.
